Csysfetch is a minimal command line system info fetcher. Csysfetch is fully supported to run on Linux, and there is work being done to bring support to macOS. Csysfetch is written in C primarily but calls upon bash commands and a bash script for it's functionality. In the main header file the user can easily customize the color of both the logo and system info using the provided ANSI colors.
