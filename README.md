### Csysfetch is a minimal command line system info fetcher. Csysfetch is fully supported to run on Linux, and there is work being done to bring support to macOS. Csysfetch is written in C primarily but calls upon bash commands and a bash script for it's functionality. It allows for full ANSI color customization for the display of the logo.
